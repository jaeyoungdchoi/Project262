	I believe Team A's user test was well planned and executed. They sent the stakeholders a spreadsheet
to sign up for a time and the testing experience was professional and pleasant. The instructions were
clear and easy to follow, and for the most part, they took my comments and criticism well. One of the
members tried to defend an aspect of the application, which wasn't very professional or warranted, but
besides that, it was a pleasant experience. I believe enough work has been done on the program and
enough code has been pushed due to the new features, such as adding and deleting time inputs for
project, were implemented to the application. Overall, I am pleased with the effort and advancement
Team A has made so far.
