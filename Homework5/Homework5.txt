Review of TEAM A

a.
	TEAM A started out pretty weak. They didn't seem to have a direction or plan 
for the application, didn't show much activity at all by the first or even second
deliverable, and overall did not seem motivated. But as the semester progressed, they
increased their efforts, increasing their progress and took the initiative to improve
their application. The implementation of the graph was excellent. It was creative, 
intuitive, and engaging. 

b.
	TEAM A's final presentation was significantly better than their previous
presentation. They were better prepared, less nervous, and more confident than they
were for the previous presentation. Also, tracking their presentation and showing the
result was a nice touch to the presentation. It effectively presented the application's
functions and was engaging for the audience.

c.
	Looking at their final product, it was evident that they took the test user's
advice seriously through the changes they made like changing the location of the buttons
and changing the time format to a more meaningful format of hours, minutes, and seconds.
Also, the team's recent actions on github shows that the team has been active and making
good progress. Lastly, I beleive their final product met their initial goal of making a
very user-friendly and simplified/lean application that provides time tracking functions.
