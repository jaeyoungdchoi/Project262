The prototype has seen a decent amount of progress since that last deliverable, and the prototype runs.
The application is pretty self explanatory and a few of their features such as recording time by category work.
However, I feel like they could have made more progress with the amount of time they had.
They added a few features, but no additional activities. 
It seems like the team is applying parts of the lab to the application, but not much more.
The vision statement has been revised, but it still contains grammatical and spelling errors.
The story logs make sense. (Second part of story log is missing a period)
The UI model looks good and reflects the application's design and features well.
